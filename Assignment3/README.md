# Assignment 3
## Topics of Discussion

**Main Point** 
"I think I just need to further work within GitHub and VS Code, I mainly use VS for Python and Java so getting a handle on the types of coding is a little slow for me right now."

*Secondary Point* 
"I do enjoy the work, even though I struggle with it. When I originally signed up for this class I was thinking of MySpace coding, which I thought I knew at one point but clearly do not haha.""

### List of Stuff I Learned
1. That the Web and the Internet are NOT the same
2. That you can manipulate File Explorer *while* in VS Code
3. That there's a lot more going on than I thought
