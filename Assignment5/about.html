<h1>Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>

<br>
<h2>Music For Moods</h2>
<br>
<p>I chose this one because I noticed that my music taste DRASTICALLY changes, depending on my mood. While the current algorithm that's associated with the music streaming services is pretty advanced, it gets confused sometimes. In the morning I might be bopping to Kesha, feeling hopeful for the day, and then throw it a complete curveball by lunch because something irritated me and now I'm wanting the heavy beats from Bad Omen. In my mind, this website would have algorithms associated with it (which I do not know how to set up, just fyi), but it would be more specialized, or perhaps more focused to its mood selections on the current selected mood. It could learn the more you use it, instead of tossing a couple of songs that are what you're wanting, then tossing in a completely different genre because it's a song you commonly listen to.</p>

<h2>Online Recipe Book</h2>
<br>
<p>I chose this one because I'm tired of the ads and the life stories that come with the recipes. I just want to know how to make the dang thing, not how you came up with it. I'm sure it's a great story, but I'm hungry, I'm trying to figure out what ingredients I need, and I want to eat. I also chose this one because I love to cook and bake, and I'm always looking for new recipes to try out with my boyfriend. I'm not a picky eater, so I'm willing to try anything once. I also chose this one because I know that there are people out there that are in the same boat as me, and would like to have a website that's more streamlined and less cluttered.</p>

<h2>Hobby for Hobby</h2>
<br>
<p>This idea came from me constantly wanting to learn new things, even if it's just the flavor of the week that my mind decided to focus on. But, like I've mentioned earlier, things are just so expensive these days, that I don't have the money to put aside to be able to learn whatever. I'm also pretty certain I'm not alone in this situation. It could be possibly shown as almost like a Craigslist, but more focused on what you're trying to learn, your availability, if you want to pay/looking for payment, etc.</p>
