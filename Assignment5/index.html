<p>I know that there are different music streaming services in today's era, from Spotify to Apple Music to Pandora, etc. The idea for this website is similar, however it changes it up by allowing the user on the page to select music, based on their current mood. For example, if you are feeling angry, you could listen to some Slipknot or some other heavy metal-like band. If you're in the relaxing mood, perhaps some Lofi could suit your needs. In the event that you're feeling happy, how about some "1, 2 Step" from Ciara? (that song is an underrated classic and I will die on that hill). The mood for the website varies depending on the user experience, but caters to most moods.</p>

<h2>Online Recipe Book</h2>

<p>This idea comes with a slightly exasperated tone, because I LOVE looking up new recipes to try out, HOWEVER.....I don't need to know that person's life story, nor the 1400 ads that seem to come along with it. Similar to an actual recipe book, there could be tabs that are on the side of the page, such as "Entrees" and "Desserts", etc. Once you move a recipe into the section that you want it in, it would display itself in a nice, pleasant matter, without the ads or massive text. Just what you need. Now, that being said, I could see some potential copyright issues with this, BUT, it would be a nice idea!</p>

<p>This one would be in almost in a hopeful tone, and here's the reason why. Things these days are expensive as all heck. But, there's this girl that you started seeing, and you want to learn how to play guitar to impress her. However, guitar lessons are pretty pricey and you don't have that kind of money. BUT! Don't lose all hope, because you know how to cook. And guess what, there's a guitar instructor looking for someone to teach them how to cook because they burn water all the time and are kind of sick of it. This website would allow you to help each other out and learn from one another, without having to pay for it (or do pay for it, whatever floats your boat).</p>
