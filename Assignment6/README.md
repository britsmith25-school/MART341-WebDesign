<h1>Which One?</h1>
<hr>
<p>I think I'm going to go with the Music for Moods website idea, because that one was the one I was really "feeling" when I was describing it. Mentally, I could somewhat image what I wanted to do with it, similar with what kind of artwork to put with the tiles selection, etc. Plus, I just think overall it's a generally cool idea, and not one that I have yet to see.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p> I am slightly concerned that I bit off a bit more than I can chew to be honest, with the concept idea that I have in my head vs my very, VERY minimal HTML and CSS coding experience. I do like the Dribbble layout that I reviewed on the discussion, and I had a somewhat similar idea to it. It was more in reference to the minimalist approach to let other elements of the website to shine, which is what I wanting to show along with the Music for Moods page. That, and one of the ideas that I wanted, that I think would really enhance some of the webpage, is the learning algorithm, which I myself cannot do. Which is going to affect what all I can do with it, but I am going to try my best.
