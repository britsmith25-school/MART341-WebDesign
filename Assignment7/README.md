This has turned into quite a bit more than I was realizing originally, because there's some things that I want to do that might be a bit outside of my scope of practice, so this website would be pretty basic, but hopefully I can still get my idea across when it comes along. I will say though, overall for not knowing really anything about web design at the start of the semester, I'm pretty proud overall of the whole thing. There's little bits of it that I didn't think of in the beginning that I think has really brought out the idea.
