<h2>Use of Divs</h2>
I'll use div to create the songs for the moods, and the moods themselves (x2)
<br>
<h2>Use of Spans</h2>
I'll use spans to seperate the songs per mood here, maybe with couple of songs listed so I can show an example. (x10)
<br>
<h2>Use of Audio</h2>
I will attempt to get one of the songs to play (not quite sure how yet) under the moods.
<br>
<h2>Use of Video</h2>
Perhaps on this I'll use almost like the old 90's screensaver with the pipes, something abstract to help show the changing of moods. It won't be that exact one but trying to explain it.
<br>
<h2>Use of Iframe</h2>
This will probably be how I can import the songs for right now, linking them to Youtube?
<br>
<h2>Use of Class</2>
I'll come back to this one.
<br>
<h2>Use of Escape Character</h2>
I'll come back to this one.
