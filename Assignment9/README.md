<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p><strong>The Making of the Crust!</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li> Move the oven rack to the lower third position and heat the oven to 350 degrees. Wrap the outer bottom of a 9-inch springform pan tightly with aluminum. *Tip* - If you don't have a springform pan, just use a regular pie dish, and no need to wrap in aluminum.</li>
    <li> Combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Press the crumb mixture into the bottom and about 2 inches up the sides of the pan. Bake for 10 minutes while you make the filling.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Making of the Filling!</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li> Reduce the oven to 300 degrees.</li>
    <li> In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.</li>
    <li>Add the sugar and the sour cream, beat until well combined. Add the vanilla and salt, beat on low speed until smooth.</li>
    <li>Using a silicone spatula, gently stir in the eggs just until combined. Pour the batter over the prepared crust.</li>
    <li>Fill a roasting pan with a few inches of boiling water and place the cheesecake in the center.</li>
    <li>Bake for 1 hour, OR, until the edges are set and the center is slightly joggly. Turn the oven off, leaving the cheesecake in the water bath in the oven for another hour.</li>
    <li>Remove the cheesecake from the water bath and place it on a wire rack. Run a small knife around the outer edge of the cheesecake to loosen it from the pan (if you used the springform pan) and leave it to cool at room temperature for about 1.5 hours. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours overnight.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Making of the Sauce!</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Add the diced favorite berries and cornstarch to the bowl of a food processor and process until smooth. Transfer to a medium saucepan and add the sugar.</li>
    <li>Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until thickened, around 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla, salt, and chopped favorite berries. Set aside to cool for about 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li> Spread over the cheesecake when you are ready to serve!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Additional Tips:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>To enhance the sauce a little bit, add the juice from half a lemon. Really makes the berries pop, and, helps keep the color!</li>
    <li>If you feel that your sauce has a bit too many seeds, feel free to strain it after it has cooked on the stove, it'll make it easier to do so.</li>
    <li>On the filling, you can also use some of your sauce to add some pretty swirls in it.</li>
