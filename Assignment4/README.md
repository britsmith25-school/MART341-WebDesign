<p> DOM is the Document Object Model and stipulates how a document on the interface can be accessed and changed, by defining its structure and representing the documents as nodes on a tree.</p>
<p> HTML is the foundation and structure of the page's content, XML describes the displayed HTML items, and XHTML is a hybrid between the two. </p>
<p> The Four Essential items are <!DOCTYPE>, <root>, <head>, <body>.</p>
<p> The purpose of the index.html is when a browser is handed an unspecified file, it goes to the index to look and see what it is.</p>
